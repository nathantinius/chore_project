# Chore Project

## Problem:
4 Kids "bored" in quarantine

## Solution: 
Build a 30min commandline app to give them chores in a fun and interactive mannor.

- Needs to recieve input from the kids
- Based on who puts their name return a chore from their chore list.
- Make sure they can't put random names in
- If they try and put in the baby's name (Winnie) return "No chores for you."
